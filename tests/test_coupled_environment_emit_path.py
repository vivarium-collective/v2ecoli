"""The coupled composite must declare ``environment`` as an emit path.

Regression test from a coupled bioreactor campaign: the declared-emit switch
replaced each runner's hand-curated allow-list with the composite's own
declaration, and
``environment`` was not in it -- so ``environment.exchange.*`` (the per-agent
exchange fluxes the coupled analyses read) stopped being persisted. The run
completed normally and the columns were simply absent, which is why nothing
failed at dispatch time.

``environment`` is AGENT-RELATIVE: the coupler reads
``agents.*.environment.exchange``. It therefore belongs in the declared paths
and must NOT be added to COUPLED_DOCUMENT_EMIT_ROOTS, which is for the stores
wired upward out of the agent frame (reactor / population / lineage).
