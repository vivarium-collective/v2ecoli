"""Native port of vEcoli ``ecoli/analysis/multiseed/cd1_exchange_fluxes.py``.

Per-cell mean external exchange flux for every exchanged metabolite, plus the
mean growth rate, as a wide TSV: one row per compound (and one for
``growth_rate_h``), one column per cell, plus the across-cell mean and standard
deviation.  Registered as ``"cd1_exchange_fluxes"`` (scale: ``"multiseed"``).

The vEcoli original carries a stale ``TODO: Implement`` banner, but its
``plot()`` is complete and is what this ports.

v2ecoli adaptations
-------------------
* **Shim E (exchange flux ordering).**  vEcoli explodes the exchange fluxes
  into one column per molecule and discovers them by ``fnmatch`` on
  ``listeners__fba_results__external_exchange_fluxes__*``.  v2ecoli emits a
  single 87-wide list column with no per-element names, so the port indexes it
  by :func:`~v2ecoli.workflow.analyses._shims.external_exchange_molecule_ids`
  (the sorted external-exchange molecule ids) — see ``_shims`` for why that is
  the emitted order and how it was verified.
* Each cell's FIRST emitted row carries a zero-length flux list (emitted before
  FBA has solved).  Indexing an empty list yields NULL, which ``AVG`` skips, so
  those rows drop out on their own.
* The TSV is returned as ``data["tsv"]`` instead of being written to ``outdir``
  (the runner places it under the sweep's ``ptools/`` dir).
* **Redux binding.**  ``ecoli-metabolism-redux`` never emits
  ``external_exchange_fluxes``; it emits the LP-raw exchange per molecule as
  ``listeners__fba_results__estimated_exchange_dmdt__<MOL>[c|p]`` — molecule
  COUNTS per tick, UPTAKE POSITIVE (the LP sign; redux negates its own
  ``environment.exchange`` to the canonical convention but keeps this leaf raw).
  Measured on a real J3 sweep (CD2 Run 2, sim 666): a 2×1 with the swap wrote 65
  ``fba_results`` columns and none of them was ``external_exchange_fluxes``.
  When the classic column is absent, this analysis binds those columns instead
  and converts each one exactly as the ``ExchangeFluxListener`` does —
  ``counts_to_gdcw_rate`` — then flips the sign, so the TSV is the same quantity
  in the same units and convention (mmol/gDCW/h, uptake negative) either way.
  Verified against that listener's own ``listeners__exchange_flux__glucose_exchange``
  on sim 666: median ratio −1.0000 over 136 rows. Two things a narrower binding
  would get wrong (@cplong90): violacein is the ONE exchange secreted from ``[c]``
  (``metabolism_redux.py`` adds ``VIOLACEIN[c]`` explicitly), so the match is on
  the prefix, compartment-agnostic; and the sign must flip, or a yield computed
  as ``product / abs(glucose)`` silently reads backwards (v2ecoli#86).
