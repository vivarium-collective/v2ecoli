"""Byte-identity tripwire for the ecoli-sources bundle.

Once the local ``flat/`` tree is deleted, the legacy-vs-bundle parity tests
(``test_kb_bundle_parity``, ``test_inherited_keys_match_ecoli_sources_content``)
skip — so nothing else actively guards the migration's core promise: that ParCa
reads the exact bytes parity was validated against.

This test pins SHA-256 of a few representative inherited keys (served from the
rev-pinned ``ecoli-sources`` package) and the 3 v2ecoli override keys (served
from local ``flat_overrides/``). It does NOT skip. If someone bumps the
``ecoli-sources`` pin in ``pyproject.toml`` to content-different data, or
changes an override file, this fails loudly — forcing a deliberate
re-validation of ParCa parity and an update of these pins.

It also asserts the source split is correct: override keys resolve into
``flat_overrides/``; inherited keys resolve out of the installed ecoli-sources
package (NOT ``flat_overrides/``).
