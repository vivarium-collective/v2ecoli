"""Acceptance gate: turn silent-success into loud failure for a run's output.

A run can exit 0, divide, and write a valid-looking store while producing NONE of
the observables the study exists to measure. A declared emit path that yields no
column is silent (sms-ecoli#210: "the check is the column list, not the exit
code"); a swapped process can be dropped between API and runner and the run still
completes green on the wild-type; a KPI column can be present and read exactly
zero. Presence/effect checks (a non-empty store, global_time advanced) pass all of
these.

This gate asserts, FROM THE ARTIFACT, what a study's output must satisfy:

  1. Required columns exist in the hive-partitioned history parquet, each with at
     least one non-null row. The required list is the study's OUTPUT CONTRACT and
     belongs in the versioned run config, not in code. A column can also be held
     to a fixed value (``must_equal``, e.g. the study's media_id -- a run against
     the wrong condition carries a present, single-valued column a bare presence
     check waves through) or required to vary (``must_vary``, a dead channel).
  2. (optional) The composite that actually ran contained the processes the
     submission declared, and none it declared forbidden -- closes the wild-type
     / dropped-injected_processes class, and the wrong-strain-still-carrying-the-
     stock-process case, without first winning the root-cause hunt for where they
     drop.
  3. (optional) The bulk species count matches the expected strain fingerprint
     (16,321 stock vs 16,323+ genuine) -- catches a candidate run staged from the
     stock cache whose columns and processes all look right, the failure class one
     leg downstream of the viva-api#437 staging fix.

It is route-independent: importable from run_pbg, a raw compute job, or a
post-run check, and it reads local paths or s3:// the same way (via sweep_io).
It writes a verdict.json so status can be derived from the verdict rather than a
container exit code (which has been wrong in both directions, sms-ecoli#210).

Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL, 2 = the gate could not run (bad inputs). Kept
distinct from check_run_complete.py's exit-2-for-expected-partial convention so a
wrapper never confuses "gate could not run" with "run incomplete".

    Column names are the double-underscore-flattened emit paths the parquet
    carries (e.g. ``listeners__mass__dry_mass``), NOT slash paths. Returns a dict
    with ``passed`` and a per-column ``{present, nonnull_rows, distinct}`` map.

    A missing column and a present-but-all-null column both fail. For any column
    named in ``must_vary``, ``distinct <= 1`` also fails: a column pinned at its
    seed value is a dead channel wearing a column name (cplong90, sms-ecoli#210),
    and it passes a bare presence check. ``distinct`` is reported for every column
    so a reviewer can spot a dead channel even when it is not enforced.

    ``must_equal`` maps a column to the value EVERY non-null row must hold (e.g.
    ``{"environment__media_id": "basal_with_trp"}``). A run against the wrong
    media or condition carries a present, non-null, single-valued column that a
    presence check waves through; must_equal is how a study pins the condition it
    meant to run. A column named in must_equal need not be in ``required_columns``

    being absent, fails. The per-column entry gains ``{expected, mismatch_rows}``.
