"""reactor_bird_coupled — baseline_population + BiRD reactor + cell<->reactor coupler.

Build-phase wire-up for mbp-03-reactor-coupling (req-2). This is the
multiscale-bioprocess composite: it composes v2ecoli's single-cell whole-cell
model (with the population aggregator) against the BiRD bioreactor transport
physics, mediated by the :class:`ReactorCellCoupler` Step.

Topology (Option B of the v2ecoli <-> pbg-bioreactordesign coupling — BiRD owns
transport, v2ecoli owns biomass + metabolic demand)::

    baseline_population (cell side)
      agents.0.*            single-cell WCM
      population.*          PopulationAggregator output (biomass_concentration_gL, ...)
      environment.*         top-level env store (external_concentrations, media_id)
        environment_driver  EnvironmentDriver in external_store mode (no-op; the
                            coupler is the env source of truth)
        environment_mirror  propagates environment.external_concentrations ->
                            agents.*.boundary.external each tick

    reactor.*               shared reactor stores (mg/L gases, g/L biomass)
      reactor_transport     BiRDTransportProcess (local:BiRDTransportProcess)
      reactor_cell_coupler  ReactorCellCoupler Step

Shared-store / additive-delta convention (mirrors
``pbg_bioreactordesign.composites._factory.make_coupled_document``):

  * ``reactor.dissolved_o2`` / ``reactor.dissolved_co2`` are bare ``float``
    leaves. BOTH BiRDTransportProcess (transport, +) and ReactorCellCoupler
    (consumption, -) write ADDITIVE deltas to them; process-bigraph's ``float``
    ``_apply`` sums the two contributions, so the net change each tick is
    ``transport - consumption``.
  * ``reactor.biomass`` is ``overwrite[float]``: the coupler passes the
    population biomass concentration through (absolute value), and
    BiRDTransportProcess reads it as a read-only input.

Port-schema subtlety (load-bearing — verified empirically against the PB
realize/project path): ReactorCellCoupler declares a single ``reactor`` output
port typed ``InPlaceDict`` (an empty Node). When the ``reactor`` store becomes a
structured tree (because BiRDTransportProcess wires ``dissolved_o2`` /
``dissolved_co2`` as concrete ``float`` leaf outputs), PB projects the coupler's
update per-leaf and DROPS any leaf the port schema doesn't enumerate — so
``reactor.biomass`` would silently never apply. We therefore OVERRIDE the
coupler edge's ``_outputs['reactor']`` with an explicit per-leaf schema
(``biomass: overwrite[float]``, ``dissolved_o2/co2: float``) so biomass routes
(overwrite) while the gases stay additive. The gases alone propagate even
without the override (they have transport leaf-output ports), but biomass does
not; the override fixes both consistently.

# `[m@31Aug]` A 40 mM-glucose batch run exhausted ammonium outright by OD ~12.7,
# and growth then continued past exhaustion. Sizing N off the recipe leaves an
# OD10 run on a knife edge where a slightly faster seed hits the wall.
