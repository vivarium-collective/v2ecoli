"""Flagellar motor switch complex (C-ring) assembly — moved out of Gillespie
SSA for the same numerical reason as filament elongation, but modeled as
fast/immediate, not rate-limited.

Added 2026-08-06, part of Maya Abdalla's flagella-cascade investigation.

Why this isn't a Gillespie complexation reaction
--------------------------------------------------
CPLX0-7450_RXN (FliG(-34) + FliM(-34) + FliN(-111) -> CPLX0-7450) was added
this session as a real, previously-missing staged intermediate (see
complexation_reactions_added.tsv). On its own it's not obviously worse than
other large-coefficient reactions already safe in this model (e.g. the
pre-existing, unmodified LUMAZINESYN-CPLX_RXN has a coefficient of 60) --
but combined with FLAGELLAR-MOTOR-COMPLEX_RXN's own several simultaneously
large coefficients, ParCa's step_05_fit_condition.py (calculateBulkDistributions,
which runs the WHOLE complexation network through Gillespie SSA with an
enormous 2**31 s time step from raw expression-derived counts) reproducibly
hit "failed simulation: total propensity is NaN". Direct diagnosis (excluding
CPLX0-7452_RXN alone, then also CPLX0-7450_RXN alone) confirmed neither
exclusion alone was sufficient -- FLAGELLAR-MOTOR-COMPLEX_RXN's own combination
of FIVE simultaneous double-digit coefficients (FlgH:26, MotA:55, MotB:22,
FlgG:24, FliF:34) is implicated too, likely because propensity for a
multi-reactant reaction is a PRODUCT of per-reactant combinatorial terms --
several large-but-individually-survivable coefficients multiplied together
can still overflow even when no single one does on its own.

Both CPLX0-7450_RXN and FLAGELLAR-MOTOR-COMPLEX_RXN are excluded from
sim_data.process.complexation (see complexation.py's RUNTIME_EXCLUDED_REACTIONS)
and replaced by this Step and flagella_motor_complex_assembly.py.

Unlike filament elongation (genuinely slow, incremental biology -- Renault
et al. 2017) or nucleation (genuinely rare -- Chang/Sung/Hong 2025), ordinary
complex assembly from already-available subunits IS supposed to be fast --
the ONLY reason this moved out of Gillespie is numerical, not biological.
So this Step is deliberately NOT rate-limited: it converts as much material
as is available every tick, matching the character of ordinary fast
complexation (uniform sim_data.constants.complexation_rate), just computed
deterministically instead of stochastically.

Real stoichiometry (all from cryo-EM structural studies, see
complexation_reactions_added.tsv for full citations): FliG=34 (C-ring
34-fold symmetry), FliM=34, FliN=111+/-13 ("Precise Measurement of the
Stoichiometry of the Adaptive Bacterial Flagellar Switch," PMC10128058).
