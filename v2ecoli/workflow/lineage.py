"""LineageProcess — one (variant, seed) lineage as an embeddable Process.

Wraps a baseline cell composite (the EcoliWCM embedding pattern) and runs it
generation-by-generation, carrying a single daughter forward (vEcoli's
``single_daughters=true`` default). Variant overrides are applied at build
time. Each generation emits partitioned parquet (default), a hive-partitioned
zarr store via an external XArrayEmitter (``emitter == "xarray"`` — the
validated v2ecoli/library/xarray_run.py pattern) with its own metadata, or
BOTH (``emitter == "both"``), which is what a batch run wants: the parquet
sweep is what the DuckDB analyses read, the zarr store is what the workspace's
xarray emitter and the dashboard's per-run charts read. The meta-composite
ticks this process via update(); it reports ``complete`` when ``generations``
cells have been run.

        * **Timed out, no division** — the agent subtree is still in

        * **Divided** — ``Division`` has already returned

          ``flush_parquet`` finds nothing to close. The emitter is still in the

          with (``self._agent_id``: "0", "00", ...).

        ``Division`` cannot derive that key. Inside the composite the cell is
        always the ``agents/0`` key, and the parquet override it reads to
        recover the runner's identity is already cleared by
        ``_build_generation`` before the composite is constructed -- so its
        lookup falls back to "0" and MISSES for every generation after the
        first. The finalize therefore happens here, in the object that owns the

        its ``success/`` sentinel while the summary still records
        ``divided: true`` with a full duration -- and a missing sentinel drops
        the whole generation from any analysis that filters on ``success_sql``,

        time early (sim 898, sms-ecoli#166, 2026-09-10).

        Precedence: (1) a division timestamp stamped onto a NEW daughter agent
        (``global_time``) -- but only if it ADVANCES the clock. The Division step
        rebuilds each daughter document from ``baseline()``, whose ``global_time``
        is ``0.0`` (``ecoli_baseline.py``), so on the real composite the stamp is
        0.0, not the division time. The first version of this method (#767)
        returned that 0.0: ``_gen_elapsed`` never advanced, ``lineage_time_offset``
        stayed 0 across every generation, ``summary.json`` recorded
        ``duration 0.0`` five times, and Run 3's cumulative 10,000 s dose never
        fired at all (sims 946/947, 2026-09-10) -- #767 had moved the bug from
        "3,600 x n, early" to "0, never". (2) The inner composite's own clock,
        which restarts at 0 every generation and stops where the run stopped;
        on the ``LineageStep`` path the run stops at the division signal, so the
        clock IS the division time (2,528 s on 898/946/947). (3) The previous
        value plus ``interval`` -- the old behaviour, kept for a composite that
        exposes neither (stubs).

        With ``_run_until_division`` polling for the division every
        ``division_poll_interval`` seconds, the inner clock IS the division time
        to within one slice on every path, so it is consulted FIRST. The
        daughter stamp is only a fallback for a composite that does not expose a
        clock: on the single-window path the daughters have been alive for 0-10 s
        at the slice break, and ``previous`` is 0.0 there (the whole generation is
        one ``update()`` call), so a stamp-first rule booked those few seconds as
        the generation and the lineage offset never advanced (sim 958, five
        generations, cumulative 14,645 s of simulated time and the 10,000 s dose
        never fired). On the tick-driven path ``previous`` is already near the
        division when it lands, which is why the same rule was correct there
