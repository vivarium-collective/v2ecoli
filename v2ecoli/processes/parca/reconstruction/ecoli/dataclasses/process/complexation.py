    # CPLX0-7452_RXN (flagella-cascade investigation, 2026-08-06): its real
    # FliC coefficient (-20000, complexation_reactions_modified.tsv) makes
    # Gillespie SSA's combinatorial propensity calculation blow up
    # numerically -- confirmed directly via macOS `sample` on a hung ParCa
    # run (astronomically large values, ~1e19-1e35, computed inside
    # stochastic_arrow/arrowhead's propensity code) and reproduced twice: an
    # earlier fix that only filtered sim_data.py's get_complexation_config
    # (the runtime cache) was insufficient because step_05_fit_condition.py
    # reads this class's reaction set directly too, hitting the identical
    # blowup during ParCa's OWN fitting. Excluding it HERE is the actual
    # root-cause fix -- every downstream consumer of
    # sim_data.process.complexation is automatically protected. The real,
    # incremental version of flagellum completion is handled instead by
    # ecoli-flagella-filament-nucleation + ecoli-flagella-filament-elongation
    # (ordinary Step-level array arithmetic, no combinatorics) -- see

    # alone was NOT sufficient -- step_05_fit_condition.py's
    # calculateBulkDistributions runs the WHOLE complexation network through
    # the Gillespie engine with an enormous time step (2**31 s) starting from
    # raw expression-derived counts, to reach steady state. "failed
    # simulation: total propensity is NaN" reproduced within ~1 min even
    # with CPLX0-7452_RXN excluded, AND STILL reproduced with CPLX0-7450_RXN
    # also excluded. Root-caused by directly comparing coefficient
    # magnitudes network-wide: the pre-existing, unmodified LUMAZINESYN-
    # CPLX_RXN already has a coefficient of 60 and has never caused this, so
    # a single large coefficient isn't inherently fatal -- but
    # FLAGELLAR-MOTOR-COMPLEX_RXN has FIVE simultaneous double-digit
    # coefficients (FlgH:26, MotA:55, MotB:22, FlgG:24, FliF:34). Propensity

        # FliC per flagellum -- the real, literature-cited filament subunit
        # count (a previous "-1" placeholder was off by four to five orders of
        # magnitude). That makes the mass terms in this reaction's balance
        # column ~1e9 in magnitude, at which point double-precision summation
        # alone produces an absolute residual (~1.9e-8) that is a RELATIVE
        # error of only ~1.9e-17 -- at the floor of what a double can even

        # this exact failure mode recurring once before: "had to bump this up
        # to 1e-8 because of flagella supercomplex".) Rather than bump the
        # same brittle absolute threshold a third time (it will just fail
        # again the next time an even larger complex is added), the tolerance
        # is now scaled to the magnitude of each reaction's own terms: a small
        # absolute floor (atol) for ordinary small reactions, plus a tiny
        # relative allowance (rtol) proportional to that reaction's largest
        # mass term. rtol=1e-13 is ~1000x looser than the ~1e-17 relative
        # noise actually observed (comfortable safety margin for floating-
        # point roundoff) but still ~13 orders of magnitude tighter than any
        # real stoichiometry bug would produce (a genuinely wrong/missing
        # reactant leaves an imbalance comparable in magnitude to that
