"""Cell-level extraction of vector observables for the report card.

Transcriptome / proteome / exchange-flux axes are *vectors* (one value per
gene / protein / exchange reaction). Following the cell-level discipline used
everywhere in the card: time-average each vector **within** a cell (one vector
per cell), then take the ensemble mean across the N cells that pass burn-in.
The ensemble-mean vector is what the card grades (R^2 vs the pinned reference)
and plots (scatter).

This reads the sweep parquet directly (the array columns aren't carried in the
scalar per-cell records). It is heavier than the scalar analysis (~minute over
a 4x8 ensemble), so it runs at report-render time, not in the workflow step.

``sweep_dir`` may be a local path or an ``s3://`` URI (see
:mod:`v2ecoli.library.sweep_io`). The S3 form lets an equivalence reference be
pinned — and a measured card rendered — against a sweep that never lands on the
local disk, which is what makes a multi-condition card affordable: the parquet
stays in object storage and DuckDB's column projection reads only the three
array columns below.

# Bump whenever a node's CONTENT changes — the aggregation semantics (the column
# set, the ragged-row rule, the cell-first order) *or* the set of keys a node
# carries. It is part of the sim_vector_cache key, so a bump invalidates every
# cached vector rather than silently serving one built by older code — the vector
# is a function of this code as much as of the run.
#
# v1 -> v2: every group now carries ``per_cell`` (was: fluxes only) and every node
# declares its ``units``. Neither changes a single number, which is exactly why
# the bump is needed rather than optional: a v1 envelope and a v2 envelope are
# numerically identical, so nothing else would tell a consumer asking for
# ``per_cell`` that this cache simply predates it. Without the bump, "the run
# recorded no per-cell samples" and "this file was written by older code" are
# indistinguishable — and the first is a fact about the run, the second a fact
# about the tooling.
#
# v2 -> v3: a node's CONTENT can change, because a group whose observable column
# is absent from the sweep is now OMITTED rather than the whole extraction
# failing. An envelope written by v2 for a sweep that v2 could not read does not
# exist -- but one written by v2 for a sweep whose column set has since changed
# would differ, and the cache key is the only thing that distinguishes them.
#
# v3 -> v4: cells that are not complete cell cycles are excluded from the
# ensemble, and a node carries `n_cells_excluded_partial` plus
# `partial_cell_detection`. Content AND keys change, so the bump is required
# twice over. A v3 envelope was written WITHOUT the exclusion and its numbers
# are plausible, so nothing but the key distinguishes them.
#
# v4 -> v5: exchange fluxes are DERIVED from per-species dmdt counts on sweeps
# that do not write the classic array, so a whole GROUP appears that a v4
# envelope for the same sweep does not contain. ⛔ Without the bump,
# `load_or_extract` serves the v4 file and the `fluxes` group is silently
# absent — which is exactly the indistinguishability this doctrine exists to
# prevent: "this run exchanged nothing we can read" and "this envelope predates
# the derivation" would look identical, and the first is a fact about the run
# while the second is a fact about the tooling.
#
# v5 -> v6: a cell is identified by EVERY partition key the sweep carries --
# ``experiment_id`` and ``variant`` join ``(lineage_seed, generation, agent_id)``
# when present (#776). A sweep whose variants or experiments reuse a lineage seed
# was merged into one pseudo-cell per generation: ``n_cells`` 1 where ten exist,
# per-cell means pooled across variants, and the median timestep lagged across a
# variant boundary, which scales every derived flux. The numbers change for
# exactly those sweeps and for no other, so only the key tells a v5 envelope for
# one of them apart from a correct one.
