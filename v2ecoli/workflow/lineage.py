"""LineageProcess — one (variant, seed) lineage as an embeddable Process.

Wraps a baseline cell composite (the EcoliWCM embedding pattern) and runs it
generation-by-generation, carrying a single daughter forward (vEcoli's
``single_daughters=true`` default). Variant overrides are applied at build
time. Each generation emits partitioned parquet (default), a hive-partitioned
zarr store via an external XArrayEmitter (``emitter == "xarray"`` — the
validated v2ecoli/library/xarray_run.py pattern) with its own metadata, or
BOTH (``emitter == "both"``), which is what a batch run wants: the parquet
sweep is what the DuckDB analyses read, the zarr store is what the workspace's
xarray emitter and the dashboard's per-run charts read. The meta-composite
ticks this process via update(); it reports ``complete`` when ``generations``
cells have been run.

        * **Timed out, no division** — the agent subtree is still in
          ``self._composite``, so ``flush_parquet`` finds the live emitter.
        * **Divided** — ``Division`` has already returned

          ``flush_parquet`` finds nothing to close. The emitter is still in the
          process-global registry under the metadata ``agent_id`` it was built
          with (``self._agent_id``: "0", "00", ...).

        ``Division`` cannot derive that key. Inside the composite the cell is
        always the ``agents/0`` key, and the parquet override it reads to
        recover the runner's identity is already cleared by
        ``_build_generation`` before the composite is constructed -- so its
        lookup falls back to "0" and MISSES for every generation after the
        first. The finalize therefore happens here, in the object that owns the
        key. Without it a generation >= 1 silently loses its trailing batch AND
        its ``success/`` sentinel while the summary still records
        ``divided: true`` with a full duration -- and a missing sentinel drops
        the whole generation from any analysis that filters on ``success_sql``,
