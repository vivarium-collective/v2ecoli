"""ReactorCellCoupler — bridge v2ecoli's cell population to the BiRD reactor.

Build-phase scaffold for mbp-03 (req-2). PBG Step that runs each emit cycle,
implementing **Option B** of the v2ecoli <-> pbg-bioreactordesign coupling:

  * BiRD owns transport physics + reads biomass as an input.
  * v2ecoli owns biomass + the metabolic exchange demand.

This Step is the thin translator between the two halves. Each cycle it:

1. **Biomass passthrough.** Read ``population.biomass_concentration_gL`` (g/L,
   produced by :class:`PopulationAggregator`) and write it to
   ``reactor.biomass`` (g/L) for ``BiRDTransportProcess`` to consume. This is a
   passthrough/overwrite of the absolute value (the ``reactor.biomass`` port
   must be wired as an overwrite type in the composite).

2. **Dissolved-gas -> environment concentration.** Read ``reactor.dissolved_o2``
   and ``reactor.dissolved_co2`` (mg/L) and write the cell environment's
   ``external_concentrations`` (mM) for the two gases.

   Conversion (the load-bearing one):

       mM = (mg/L) / MW[g/mol]

   because  (mg/L) / (g/mol) = (1e-3 g/L) / (g/mol) = 1e-3 mol/L = 1 mM.
   e.g. 8 mg/L O2 / 31.999 ~= 0.25 mM. These are absolute concentrations
   (overwrite the environment port, not additive).

3. **Metabolic demand -> dissolved-gas delta.** Aggregate each agent's
   metabolic exchange flux into an *additive* dissolved-gas delta (mg/L) the
   reactor accumulates this interval:

       delta[mg/L] = counts * cells_per_agent / N_A[1/mol]
                     * MW[g/mol] * 1000[mg/g] / volume_L

   MW in g/mol numerically equals mg/mmol, so the same constant serves both
   the mM conversion and this mg/L delta.

   NOTE this is COUNT-based and touches no mass listener. An earlier revision
   of this docstring described a flux x biomass form with the biomass taken as
   ``cell_mass_fg * cells_per_agent * 1e-15`` — stale twice over: the code has
   not worked that way for some time, and ``cell_mass`` is TOTAL (wet) mass,
   ~3.33x dry, so using it as a gDW basis is the same error since corrected in
   PopulationAggregator. Do not reintroduce it.

Sign convention (verified against ``v2ecoli/processes/metabolism.py``
:func:`_fba_output_to_deltas`, lines 469-492): ``external_exchange_fluxes`` is
reported on a gDCW basis where the FBA exchange flux feeds
``delta_nutrients = (1/counts_to_molar) * exchange_fluxes`` — described there as
"the cumulative count added to the environment store". So a POSITIVE flux means
the molecule is *secreted* (added to the environment) and a NEGATIVE flux means
*uptake* (removed). Therefore O2 (consumed) carries a negative flux and yields a
NEGATIVE ``reactor.dissolved_o2`` delta (uptake depletes dissolved O2), while
CO2 (produced) carries a positive flux and yields a POSITIVE
``reactor.dissolved_co2`` delta. The Step passes the signed flux straight
through the conversion chain, so the sign is preserved without special-casing.

Time base: ``BiRDTransportProcess`` works in HOURS, while v2ecoli's cell sim
steps in SECONDS. The metabolic-exchange path needs NO interval scaling: it
differences ``environment.exchange``, a cumulative COUNT, and one difference
already covers exactly one WCM step. ``SECONDS_PER_HOUR`` and ``FG_PER_GRAM``
are retained as published constants but are not used by this Step; an earlier
version of this docstring described a per-hour flux conversion that the code
has never performed.

⚠ STANDING HAZARD for anything cumulative added to this Step
------------------------------------------------------------
The Step flow runs ONCE AT CYCLE START, before the processes and before the
PopulationAggregator have written anything (measured: ``calls_per_tick =
[2,1,1,...]``), so the first invocation sees an unpopulated state -- notably
``population.biomass_concentration_gL == 0.0``.

Any quantity that latches "the initial value" on its first invocation latches a
pre-population zero. Two distinct defects have come from this:

* mbp-03's O2 mass balance anchored its numerator after tick 0 while its
  denominator was anchored before it -- a 5.3% phantom deficit read as a leak;
* the per-agent first-observation rule exists precisely because tick 0's
  exchange store is not yet meaningful.

=> Defer the baseline until the store you depend on is live, and latch every
related baseline together so they refer to the same instant.

            # into a sawtooth:
            #
            #   transport adds one tick of OTR   ->  dissolved_o2 = OTR*dt

            # and never observes the zero. Measured on a 6-generation coupled
            # run: the cell's O2 sat at exactly 0.0011881823 mM for 7,107 of
            # 18,566 ticks while the reactor read 0.0000, and
            #   kLa * C* / 3600 = 20.7868 * 6.5847 / 3600 = 0.03802079 mg/L

            # the timestep, which made oxygen availability a property of the
            # integration step rather than of the process.
            #
            # Publishing post-consumption reports the concentration the cell
            # leaves behind rather than the one transport handed it. Neither
            # endpoint is the tick average -- the physically exact choice would
            # integrate over the tick -- but the pre-consumption value cannot
            # express scarcity at all under a replenished-then-clamped species,
            # and this one can.
            #
            # ⛔ The clamp above is CORRECT and must stay: it prevents a negative
            # store. The defect was never the clamp, only what was published
            # before it ran.
            # ⛔ O2 ONLY. CO2 is deliberately NOT corrected here, and the
            # symmetry is a trap: co2_counts is "positive == secretion"
            # (:317), so co2_delta > 0 and the same expression publishes a
            # HIGHER CO2 -- the cell reading carbon dioxide it produced within
            # the same tick, an instantaneous self-feedback. That is the
            # opposite direction to the O2 correction, which REMOVES a
            # fictitious supply.
            #
            # It is also not small. Measured by the same direct A/B:
            #   dissolved_co2 0.5 mg/L, 1e7 counts secreted: 0.01136 -> 0.02797 mM (2.5x)
            #                           5e7 counts:          0.01136 -> 0.09439 mM (8.3x)
            #   dissolved_co2 0.05 mg/L, 1e7 counts:         0.00114 -> 0.01774 mM (15.6x)
            #
            # And no CO2 defect exists to fix. The sawtooth needs a species that
            # is REPLENISHED and then CLAMPED to zero; CO2 is secreted, and its
            # clamp (:432) tests `co2_delta < 0.0`, so it fires only on uptake
            # and effectively never. Same reasoning excludes glucose and
            # ammonium: an unreplenished pool reaches zero and stays there, so
            # the cell does see exhaustion (confirmed on a 6-generation run --
            # cell GLC tracked the reactor to 0, max deviation 0.177 mM).
            #
            # ⚠ AND THAT EXEMPTION IS CONDITIONAL, NOT CATEGORICAL: it holds
            # only while CO2 is NET-SECRETED, which is what the clamp's
            # `< 0.0` gate encodes. If a condition ever nets CO2 UPTAKE the
            # clamp fires, the sawtooth becomes reachable, and this correction
            # is absent for it. That is not hypothetical -- an anoxic regime
            # becomes reachable for the first time BECAUSE of this fix (O2 can
            # now leave allowed_exchange_uptake), and an anoxic carbon balance
            # is exactly where the aerobic assumption is least safe.
