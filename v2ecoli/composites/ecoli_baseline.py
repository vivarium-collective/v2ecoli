    ``_vecoli_reference_state`` builds the genuine upstream vEcoli engine
    from ``match_simdata`` (a reference ``simData.cPickle`` path) and reads

    stochastic low-copy sampling divergence — e.g. SpoT — that otherwise
    dominates single-seed comparisons; see run_comparison_ensemble.py's

    """In-document, agent-relative XArrayEmitter — built LAZILY from realized state.

    Subclasses ``process_bigraph.emitter.Emitter`` (not a bare ``Step``) so the
    composite_generator convention recognises it as the document's observation
    sink (``process_bigraph.emitter._node_is_emitter`` short-circuits on
    ``isinstance(instance, Emitter)``). Without that, ``CompositeSpec._with_emitters``
    treats the document as observing nothing and injects the generator's declared
    ParquetEmitter default at the top level with an empty ``out_dir`` — which then
    fails ``Composite`` realize.

    Swapped into the single ``agents/0/emitter`` key in place (never as an extra
    document Step: adding sibling Steps perturbs process_bigraph's scheduling and
    trips a pre-existing metabolism fragility — Task 1 gotcha #4). It wraps a real
    ``viva_emitters.XArrayEmitter`` but defers its construction to the FIRST
    ``update()`` so the view/output_metadata are discovered from the fully
    REALIZED composite state, resolving the two Task-4 blockers:

      * **C2 (realized-state view).** At document-build time the listener tree is
        only partially materialised — ``core.realize()`` fills the schema-defaulted
        listener namespaces only when the ``Composite`` is constructed, and per-tick
        listener vectors are populated only once processes run. Building the view
        then captures ~4 leaves. This step instead reaches the driving ``Composite``
        via ``get_current_composite()`` (the ``run()`` contextvar) on its first
        ``update()`` and reads the full realized ``agents/0`` subtree — yielding the
        complete listener set (~50-115 leaves) plus process-instance-derived named
        coord labels via ``output_metadata(full_state)``. Mirrors the multigen
        runner's "warm 1 tick, then discover coords" pattern.

      * **C1 (structured ``bulk``).** ``cell_state["bulk"]`` is a numpy *record*
        array (fields ``id``/``count``/``*_submass``); the transducer cannot cast
        it to ``<i8``. This step projects ``bulk["count"]`` to a plain int64 vector
        inside ``update()`` before emitting (no field-projection hook exists in the
        emitter's view machinery).

    The trailing partial buffer is flushed by ``close_emitter()`` (called by
    ``v2ecoli.build_composite``'s run-wrap): the emitter only auto-flushes a FULL
    buffer mid-run, and ``flush(final=False)`` asserts a full buffer, so a partial
    tail can only be written via ``close()``/``flush(final=True)``.

    The biological feature set is assembled from the boolean toggles
    (``ppgpp_regulation`` on by default; the rest off) plus any opt-in
    modules a caller registered via :func:`enable_features` (back-compat).

    Args:
        core: bigraph-schema core.  If None, one is created via build_core().
        seed: Random seed for stochastic initialisation.
        cache_dir: Path to the ParCa cache directory (must contain
            ``initial_state.json`` and ``sim_data_cache.dill``).
        match_simdata: optional path to a reference vEcoli simData.cPickle.
            When set, overlays that reference's genuine-vEcoli pre-run bulk
            molecule counts onto this composite's initial state (the same
            matched-initial-state mechanism run_comparison_ensemble.py

            None (default) leaves the baseline's own cached initial state
            unchanged.
        match_condition: vEcoli growth condition to build the reference
            engine under when resolving match_simdata's overlay. Only
            consulted when match_simdata is set. Threads a paired
            comparison's per-config condition into the matched-init overlay
            (Task 4's materializer sets this to the same condition it drives
            on the reference `vecoli` composite); defaults to "basal" for
            back-compat.
        transcript_initiation_mode: Phase-2 opt-in for the PDMP transcript
            initiation dispatch — ``discrete`` (default) or the piecewise-
            deterministic mode.
        polypeptide_initiation_mode: same dispatch as
            ``transcript_initiation_mode`` but for polypeptide initiation.
        config_overrides: declarative '<process>.<key>': value config patches
            (variants), applied on top of any knockout patch.
        knockouts: genes to knock out at the translation level (EcoCyc gene ids
            or monomer ids). Each gene's translation efficiency is zeroed on the
            cached polypeptide-initiation config — a functional knockout with no
            ParCa re-fit. Empty/None = plain baseline.
        media: initial growth medium — any condition in the cache's saved_media.
            Sets the environment's initial media_id so media_update shifts the
            cell onto that condition on the first tick and metabolism responds
            (lightweight media perturbation from the existing cache, no ParCa
            re-fit). 'minimal' (default) leaves it unchanged.
        n_seeds, n_generations: >1 on either switches baseline to a BATCH run —
            a one-step orchestrator document that fans out one baseline lineage
            per seed (seeds seed..seed+n_seeds-1) at run time and flushes the
            ported analyses (absorbs the former batch_baseline composite). The
            other batch knobs (single_daughters, time_step, max_duration,
            variants, out_dir, experiment_id, analyses, study, parallel,
            initial_carry_state_path, initial_generation_index,
            daughter_state_out_path) apply only in batch mode;
            knockouts/media/config_overrides carry through to every seed.
            n_seeds==1, n_generations==1 (default) = single cell.

            NOTE (issue #495): the division-aware stop lives ONLY in the
            lineage/batch machinery (BatchBaselineRunner ->
            LineageProcess._run_until_division). The plain single-cell default
            path built below has NO division-stop: the in-cell Division step
            still fires and structurally splits state into daughters, but nothing
            tells the *run* to stop, so it simulates the full requested step
            budget and keeps going past division (now simulating the daughter).
            n_generations therefore does NOT bound a plain single-cell run to one
            cell cycle — it is inert unless n_seeds>1 or n_generations>1 flips
            this into batch mode. To bound a single-cell run to one cell cycle,
            pass stop_at_division=True (see below); that routes this single-cell
            build through the same lineage machinery at n_seeds=1, generations=1
            so LineageProcess stops at the first division.
        stop_at_division: opt-in that bounds a single-cell run to ONE cell cycle
            (issue #495, Option A). When True, this build is routed through the
            lineage/batch machinery at n_seeds=1 and generations=n_generations
            (default 1), where LineageProcess._run_until_division halts the run at
            the first division instead of continuing into the daughter. Two
            consequences of routing through the lineage path:
              (i) the emitted observations take the lineage
                  ``generation=N/agent_id`` layout, NOT the flat single-cell
                  agents/0 layout the plain single-cell build emits; and
              (ii) it is INCOMPATIBLE with match_simdata (a build-time,
                  single-cell initial-state overlay that the run-time lineage
                  fan-out has no wiring for) — combining them raises ValueError.
            False (default) = unchanged full-budget single-cell behavior.
        initial_carry_state_path, initial_generation_index,
            daughter_state_out_path: batch-mode-only per-generation
            checkpoint/resume (backlog item 34) — a wave orchestrator's own
            resume hand-off, passed straight through to each branch's
            LineageProcess. Empty/0 (default) = unchanged single-invocation
            behavior; see BatchBaselineRunner/LineageProcess for the contract.
        ppgpp_regulation: insert the ppGpp-regulation feature module (default on).
        trna_attenuation: insert the tRNA-attenuation feature module (default off).
        supercoiling: insert the DNA-supercoiling feature module (default off).
        mass_conservation: insert the mass-conservation check (default off).
        emitter: observation sink for the internal 'emitter' step — one of
            ``parquet`` (default), ``sqlite``, ``xarray``, ``null``.
        emitter_out_dir: explicit output-directory override for the chosen
            single-cell emitter. Empty (default) = unchanged behavior (each
            sink resolves its own workspace-relative default). Ignored for
            ``emitter="null"``.
        bundle: optional pre-loaded cache bundle (as returned by
            ``load_cache_bundle``). When given, the cache is not re-read from
            ``cache_dir`` — lets callers building many composites from the same
            cache (ensembles, sweeps) load it once and reuse it.

    Returns:
        Process-bigraph document dict with keys ``state``,
        ``skip_initial_steps``, ``sequential_steps``, ``flow_order``.
