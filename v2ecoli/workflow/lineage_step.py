"""``LineageStep`` — a whole lineage as ONE atomic task.

Why a Step wrapping the Process, rather than the Process itself:

``run_step`` calls ``instance.invoke(state)`` **exactly once**, while
``LineageProcess.update()`` advances **one generation per call**. Registering the
Process directly as a task node would therefore run generation 0, return, and
report success — a silent truncation, and the same class of defect as every other
one this pipeline has produced. This wrapper keeps the generation loop exactly
where it is and drives it to completion inside a single invocation.

What that buys, beyond correctness:

* ``cache_dir`` becomes a real **input wire** rather than config, so a DAG engine
  can stage the ParCa bundle into the task as a ``path``. ``LineageProcess.inputs()``
  is ``{}``, which leaves the producer→consumer edge invisible.
* One result port. ``LineageProcess`` emits ``summary`` + ``complete``; ``complete``
  is loop bookkeeping, not a result, and does not belong in a task's interface.
* No ``ray:`` address is involved, so a renderer sees an ordinary class. Ray is the
  addressing layer for running N lineages concurrently; a single lineage is strictly
  sequential (each generation depends on the previous daughter), so nothing about
  one lineage needs it.

**Separability.** Everything that distinguishes one lineage from another —  seed,
variant, and any process swap — lives in *this task's own config*. A task reads its
own file and nothing else: no shared store, no ordering constraint between siblings,
no barrier before the gather. An N×M sweep is expressed by which configs exist.

    #   Failed to publish file: .../work/14/27c67.../sweep; to: .../vecoli-output/.../sweep [copy]
    #
    # Both halves of one cause. `path sweep_v0` stages N inputs under their own
    # names, so N directories called `sweep` cannot be staged; and N concurrent
    # publishDir copies to the same destination name race (measured: only 2 of 3
    # seeds published). The per-lineage name lives in `out_dir` config, which
    # workflow_nf sets to `sweep_v{vi}_s{seed}` -- this declaration cannot itself
    # vary, because `_class_annotation` reads it off the CLASS
    # (`getattr(type(instance), ...)`), so a pattern is what makes per-instance

    # `work/1d/8bdc05.../sweep/`, while the results prefix held 78 KB of render
    # artifacts and no data at all.
    #
    # A closure, not a literal: the destination is the RUN's own prefix and is
    # only known at dispatch. `params.publish_dir` is supplied by the caller
    # (viva-api passes the run's results URI); the `?:` keeps a bare
    # `nextflow run` working locally instead of failing on a missing param.

    # Each lineage publishes its OWN `sweep_v{vi}_s{seed}` into the shared target.

    # -- identity lives in the partitions, not in the directory name". That was

    # NAME, and it held only while no two tasks shared a destination (1 seed per
