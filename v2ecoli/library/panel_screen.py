"""Panel-screen grading — the science core.

A **panel screen** is N distinct designs, optionally crossed with M environmental
conditions, ranked against each other: which design wins, by how much, and at what
cost. That is a different readout from a *sweep* along one axis
(``library/phenotype_sweep``), which asks how an observable moves as one knob turns.

★ **The contract is the deliverable.** The failure this module exists to prevent is
not a missing statistic — it is **family construction**. In a prior panel analysis
Welch was applied correctly per arm, but the q-value family pooled two media, so
nearly every arm in the second medium read "significant" when most of that signal was
the medium rather than the design. A library function cannot prevent that, because the
*caller* decides the family. So here:

* ``strata`` is **required**. A panel cannot be graded without declaring what the
  testing family is (a missing declaration produces a visible failing axis, not a
  silent global family — see ``build``).
* **one BH family per stratum**, never one across the panel
  (``apply_stratified_qvalues``).
* the **reference arm is resolved within each stratum**, so a design is contrasted
  against the control it shares conditions with.
* an arm's identity (``arm``) must be unique and carry its stratum. If a label were
  derived from the design vector alone, the same design in two conditions would give
  two arms with one label, silently sharing a row. Duplicates are a hard error.

**Consumed, not reimplemented:** Welch's t-test from
``viva_superpowers.card_criteria._welch``; the verdict banding from ``_band``; the
BH-FDR step-up from ``scipy.stats.false_discovery_control``; cell-level aggregation
upstream of us (``by_cell`` is ``[[seed, gen, value], ...]``, the shape
``workflow/analysis.py`` emits and ``library/report_card._decompose`` reads).

Import-safe: no CLI, no duckdb, no sweep access. The Gen-2 Step is
``v2ecoli/workflow/report_cards/panel_screen_card.py``; observable ids, the reference
arm, the strata keys and all three bands are **study inputs** via
``report_card_refs.panel_screen`` — nothing here is organism-, product- or
pathway-specific.
