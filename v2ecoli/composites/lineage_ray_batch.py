"""Registers ``v2ecoli.workflow.batch_lineage_ray`` as a process-bigraph ``@composite_generator``
(item 101) so it resolves through compose/v1's EXISTING ``--composite-id`` mechanism the same way
``baseline``/``ecoli_colony`` already do — zero new viva-api/dispatch code needed, matching this
project's own "reuse existing patterns first" rule.

Thin registration shim, mirroring ``v2ecoli/composites/ecoli_colony.py``'s own shape exactly.
