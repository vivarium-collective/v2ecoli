"""Tests for the panel-screen report card.

Covers both layers, mirroring ``tests/test_overflow_card.py``: the science core
(``v2ecoli.library.panel_screen``) and the Gen-2 Step (``PanelScreenCard``). Grading
is fixture-driven — no live run, no ParCa cache — from the committed synthetic
fixture ``tests/fixtures/panel_screen/panel_baseline.json``.

★ The load-bearing tests here are the family-construction ones. The defect this card
exists to prevent is a q-value family pooled across conditions, and a test that passed
under both a per-stratum and a pooled family would certify exactly that defect. So
``test_qvalue_family_is_per_stratum_not_pooled`` and
``test_pooling_would_change_a_recorded_qvalue`` are written to **straddle a decision
boundary**: they fail if the family is pooled.
