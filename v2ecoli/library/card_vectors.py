"""Cell-level extraction of vector observables for the report card.

Transcriptome / proteome / exchange-flux axes are *vectors* (one value per
gene / protein / exchange reaction). Following the cell-level discipline used
everywhere in the card: time-average each vector **within** a cell (one vector
per cell), then take the ensemble mean across the N cells that pass burn-in.
The ensemble-mean vector is what the card grades (R^2 vs the pinned reference)
and plots (scatter).

This reads the sweep parquet directly (the array columns aren't carried in the
scalar per-cell records). It is heavier than the scalar analysis (~minute over
a 4x8 ensemble), so it runs at report-render time, not in the workflow step.

``sweep_dir`` may be a local path or an ``s3://`` URI (see
:mod:`v2ecoli.library.sweep_io`). The S3 form lets an equivalence reference be
pinned — and a measured card rendered — against a sweep that never lands on the
local disk, which is what makes a multi-condition card affordable: the parquet
stays in object storage and DuckDB's column projection reads only the three
array columns below.

# Bump whenever a node's CONTENT changes — the aggregation semantics (the column
# set, the ragged-row rule, the cell-first order) *or* the set of keys a node
# carries. It is part of the sim_vector_cache key, so a bump invalidates every
# cached vector rather than silently serving one built by older code — the vector
# is a function of this code as much as of the run.
#
# v1 -> v2: every group now carries ``per_cell`` (was: fluxes only) and every node
# declares its ``units``. Neither changes a single number, which is exactly why
# the bump is needed rather than optional: a v1 envelope and a v2 envelope are
# numerically identical, so nothing else would tell a consumer asking for
# ``per_cell`` that this cache simply predates it. Without the bump, "the run
# recorded no per-cell samples" and "this file was written by older code" are
# indistinguishable — and the first is a fact about the run, the second a fact
# about the tooling.
#
# v2 -> v3: a node's CONTENT can change, because a group whose observable column
# is absent from the sweep is now OMITTED rather than the whole extraction
# failing. An envelope written by v2 for a sweep that v2 could not read does not
# exist -- but one written by v2 for a sweep whose column set has since changed
# would differ, and the cache key is the only thing that distinguishes them.

    """Return ``{group: {name: {...}}}`` of cell-first aggregated vectors
    (time-mean within cell, then mean across cells).

    Each node carries the ensemble-mean ``vector``, ``n_cells``,
    ``n_cells_excluded_partial``, its ``units``, and ``per_cell`` — the
    n_cells x n_features matrix of per-cell time-mean vectors whose column mean
    IS ``vector``.

    ⭐ **Which observable columns exist is CHECKED here rather than assumed.**
    A sweep is extracted for the columns it has; a group whose column is absent
    is OMITTED, never zero-filled. Different metabolism processes write
    different exchange leaves, and that was previously fatal to the whole
    extraction rather than to the one group.

    ⛔ **KNOWN GAP, deliberately not addressed here — cells are NOT filtered.**
    Depending on how the producing runner emits daughters at division, grouping
    by ``(lineage_seed, generation, agent_id)`` can yield short birth stubs, and
    a run that stops mid-cycle leaves a truncated final generation. Both are
    averaged in as if they were complete cells, which biases every ensemble
    statistic toward the newborn state. A row-count heuristic was tried and
    withdrawn: whether a stub falls under any given fraction is a function of the
    producing run's emit cadence, so the heuristic silently did nothing on
    coarse-emit sweeps while asserting that it had. The real signal is a
    per-cell ``divided`` flag (``workflow/analysis_runner.py``), which is not
    currently an emitted parquet column. ⇒ **Callers must not treat ``n_cells``
    as a count of complete cell cycles.**

    ⚠ **A second, PRE-EXISTING inconsistency, stated because it is easy to
    assume this function prevents it and it does not:** the ragged-row rule
    below drops cells per COLUMN, so a cell emitting ``[]`` for one observable
    is absent from that group and present in the others. Different groups can
    therefore describe different cell sets, and their ``per_cell`` row indices
    do not align. Nothing in the output says so.

    Ragged/empty array rows are dropped per column: ``external_exchange_fluxes``
    emits a ``[]`` default on some timesteps, so only rows whose array matches
    the column's modal length are averaged."""

    # ⚠ Measured 2026-08-21 on an 8x16 basal sweep (50 GB of history parquet) at
    # ``generation_lower_bound=0``: 52 GB resident, 63 GB peak, 42.5 GB of 44 GB
    # swap consumed, the process pinned in uninterruptible I/O wait, and killed
    # rather than failing on its own -- taking the machine with it.
    #
    # ⚠ NOT "it could never have completed": the surviving v1 cache envelope for
    # this same sweep records ``extract_seconds: 680.76`` at ``gen_lb=3`` over
    # the same 104 cells, extracted 2026-07-30 by the ``fetchall`` code. The old
    # path completed this sweep at gen_lb=3 and blew past the machine at
    # gen_lb=0, +21% rows. The defect is that peak scales with the RUN, so the
    # margin is a property of the hardware and not of the code.
    #
    # The fix is to never hold the rows. We accumulate a RUNNING SUM per
    # (cell, column, array-length) and divide at the end, so peak memory is a

    # cells x features). For that sweep that is ~900k floats instead of billions.

    # the memory problem for an I/O one. Distinct lengths are few (a column is
