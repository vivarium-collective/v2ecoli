"""Multi-scale registrations of the PathwayTools (ptools) TSV analyses.

In vEcoli the ptools analyses live at three scales (``single``,
``multigeneration``, ``multiseed``) as byte-identical source files — the
difference is only which cells the ``history_sql`` covers and how ``read_outputs``
aggregates them by ``time``.

**Multigeneration** (:class:`_MultigenMixin`): a single-daughter lineage has
exactly one cell per generation.  vEcoli's absolute, monotonic ``time`` makes
``read_outputs``' ``GROUP BY time`` an identity (no row merges); v2ecoli's
``global_time`` resets each generation, so we rebuild the absolute axis with
:func:`_helpers.cumulative_time_history` and then reuse the single-scale
``analyze`` verbatim.  Result: the TSV spans the whole lineage with correct
minute checkpoints (e.g. 0m … 88m across two generations).

**Multiseed** (:class:`_MultiseedMixin`): a variant's slice spans MULTIPLE
independent lineages (seeds).  vEcoli's multiseed ptools is the single-cell
``plot`` re-run over the pooled parquet — ``build_query`` bins the run's absolute
time span into ``n_tp`` bins and ``AVG``\\ s each feature over all rows in a bin.
This mixin reproduces that **cross-seed mean** on v2ecoli data, aligning every
seed on the cumulative clock first (:func:`_helpers.reconstruct_cumulative_time`,
so a multi-generation run's per-generation ``global_time`` resets do not pool
different generations together), and emits an extra **cross-seed spread** panel
(the SD across seeds of each seed's per-bin mean) so heterogeneity is visible
rather than averaged away.  It reuses each concrete class's ``_feature_matrix``
extraction seam.  The legacy element-wise-SUM collapse
(:class:`_MultiseedCollapseMixin`, via :func:`_helpers.collapse_cross_seed`) is
retained only for the combined Cellular-Overview upload.

      (aligned to generation boundaries) instead of ``n_tp`` evenly-spaced ticks.
    * ``skip_n_gens=1`` — DROP the first generation and start the table at the

    Both are overridable via ``variant_metadata`` (analysis_options); the single
