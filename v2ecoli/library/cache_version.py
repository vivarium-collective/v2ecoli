"""Cache version fingerprinting.

The cache at ``out/cache/`` (``sim_data_cache.dill`` + ``initial_state.json``)
is derived from (a) the shipped ParCa fixture at ``models/parca/parca_state.pkl.gz``
and (b) the code in ``v2ecoli.library.sim_data`` and its pint-boundary
helpers.  When either side changes incompatibly — e.g. the unum→pint migration
in #18 — a cache built from the previous code drops through sim simulation
steps with obscure ``AttributeError: 'Unum' object has no attribute 'to'``
tracebacks several frames deep.

This module computes a content hash over the inputs that determine cache
compatibility, writes it into ``cache_version.json`` at build time, and
verifies it at load time.  On mismatch, ``verify_cache_version`` raises
``StaleCacheError`` with a one-line rebuild instruction — no detective work
required.

    Called from the cache load path.  A missing ``cache_version.json`` is a
    hard error too — we can't prove a pre-versioning cache is safe, so treat
    it the same as a mismatch.

    ``expected_build_params`` (P1-6) is what makes a WRONG-STRAIN cache fail.
    A caller that knows which strain/condition it *requested* (e.g. new_genes,
    bundle_overrides, condition) passes those here; every supplied key is
    compared against the bundle's stored ``build_params`` and any divergence
    raises. Without it this function has no independent notion of the request
    and cannot tell a wild-type cache apart from a new-gene cache — the silent
    failure this parameter closes. Left ``None`` (the load paths that don't
    yet know the request) the comparison is skipped and behavior is unchanged.

    ``build_params`` (A7) describes *which artifact* the cache is (condition,
    seed, n_seeds, strain, ...) — it is a property of the bundle, not something
    "current code" can independently re-derive, so recomputing "current"
    echoes ``stored.build_params`` back rather than defaulting them away.
    That keeps a real non-basal bundle (e.g. built with a non-default seed)
    from failing verification against *itself* on the file/context inputs_hash;
    the requested-vs-stored strain check above is what catches a mismatched
    ``--cache-dir``, not the echoed recompute.
    ``context`` (A9) is the opposite: it is re-probed fresh here so an
    environment change between build and load is exactly what this catches.

    ``configs`` (A6): if the stored version recorded a non-empty config set
    (bundles written after this check existed), assert
    ``REQUIRED_CACHE_CONFIG_NAMES`` is a subset of it — a bundle missing
    ``ecoli-mass-listener``/``ecoli-metabolism`` must never verify clean,
    even though neither config participates in ``inputs_hash``. A bundle
    with an *empty* recorded config set (pre-A6, or written by a caller
    that doesn't build a ``configs`` dict at all — e.g. a hand-built test
    fixture) is not asserted against: we can't distinguish "nothing was
    recorded" from "nothing is required" from the marker alone, and the
    primary defense against an incomplete bundle is the build itself
    refusing to write one (``v2ecoli.core._write_sim_input_bundle``).

    ``derived_from`` (schema 3): the provenance chain is ECHOED here, never
    recomputed — the parent artifact (the ParCa ``parca_state.pkl`` a cache was
    built on) is routinely absent at load time, so ``current`` folds
    ``stored.derived_from`` back in verbatim, exactly as ``build_params`` is
    echoed, letting a real chained cache verify against itself. Three schema-3
    guards then run on the stored chain: (a) a schema-3 cache with no chain at
    all is stale (its chassis provenance was never recorded); (b) any chain
    layer that is ``dirty`` or has a null ``commit`` WARNs loudly by default and
    hard-fails when ``require_clean_chain`` (or ``$V2E_REQUIRE_CLEAN_CHAIN``) is
    set; (c) ``expected_chassis={"commit": ...}`` fails if the chain's chassis
    layer was built from a different commit — the chain-level mirror of
    ``expected_build_params``.
