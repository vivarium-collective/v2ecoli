"""Shared helpers for native vEcoli analysis ports (the altair/polars family).

vEcoli's plot analyses lean on ``ecoli.library.parquet_emitter`` helpers
(``read_stacked_columns``, ``num_cells``, ``skip_n_gens``, ``named_idx``,
``ndidx_to_duckdb_expr``) and produce Altair charts saved to HTML.  Two things
differ in v2ecoli's parquet schema and must be bridged natively here:

  * **``time`` column** — vEcoli emits a ``time`` column; v2ecoli emits
    ``global_time``.  ``read_stacked_columns`` (and column expressions that
    reference ``time``) need it, so :func:`aliased_history` wraps any
    ``history_sql`` to expose ``global_time`` *also* as ``time``.

  * **``bulk`` column** — vEcoli emits a single ``bulk`` list column ordered to
    match ``sim_data`` bulk order.  v2ecoli emits ``bulk__id`` + ``bulk__count``
    (per-row lists in a parquet ordering that may differ from sim_data).
    :func:`bulk_field_ids` returns the parquet bulk ordering (the equivalent of
    ``field_metadata(conn, config_sql, "bulk")``), and
    :func:`bulk_count_idx_expr` builds a ``named_idx`` expression over
    ``bulk__count`` for a set of molecule ids — failing loudly if any id is
    absent (never silently dropping).

The pure SQL-expression builders ``named_idx`` and ``ndidx_to_duckdb_expr`` are
schema-agnostic, so they are re-exported from the vEcoli module unchanged.

Altair views are serialized with :func:`chart_to_html` (``chart.to_html()``),
the view-output analogue of ``chart.save(path)``.

    vEcoli emits a monotonic absolute ``time`` across a lineage, so a
    ``GROUP BY time`` over a multigeneration slice never merges rows from
    different generations.

    v2ecoli's emitter behaviour is path-dependent: the parquet emitter carries
    an **absolute** clock across generations (gen N+1's first row already comes
    after gen N's last row), while the xarray path emits ``global_time``
    relative to each generation's birth (resets to 0).  The earlier version of
    this helper *unconditionally* added the summed prior-generation durations,
    which on the already-absolute parquet data **double-offset** every
    generation after the first — inserting a spurious empty time gap between
    generations (visible as a break in the fork-position track and stretched
    sawteeth in dry mass / oriC) and inflating the lineage's total time.

    Fix: compute, per generation, the offset needed to make it start strictly
    after the previous generation's last row, then **clamp that offset at 0**.
    When ``global_time`` is already absolute (parquet path) the required offset
    is negative → clamped to 0 → the data is left untouched.  When it resets
    per generation (xarray path) the offset is positive → generations are
    stacked end-to-end with a 1-unit gap, exactly as before.

    Only valid for a single-lineage slice (one cell per generation, e.g. a
    multigeneration group); do NOT use where multiple cells share a generation
    (e.g. multiseed), as that genuinely requires cross-cell aggregation.

    Two optional params, common to any analysis aggregating over a cell's (or
    a sweep's) timeseries — ``generation_lower_bound`` (drop early generations
    as inoculation burn-in) and ``time_lower_bound`` (drop the start of each
    cell cycle). Requires a ``generation`` column and a ``time`` column (or
    alias) in scope wherever this is applied; :func:`read_stacked_columns`
    aliases v2ecoli's ``global_time`` to ``time`` for the ``cd1_*`` family, and
    the ``ptools_*`` family's ``build_query`` does the same.

    Shared by all six ``cd1_*`` omics ports and the ``ptools_*`` single/multi-
    scale exports — this is pure row-admission logic (which rows reach an
    analysis' own aggregation), not itself part of either family's
    aggregation or biological transformation.

    Historical deviation now normalized: ``cd1_fluxomics`` used to test
    ``generation_lower_bound`` for *truthiness* while the rest tested
    ``is not None``, so a bound of ``0`` was silently ignored there. This
    normalizes on ``is not None``. The two agree in effect (``generation >= 0``
    matches every row), so no output changes — the ports just stop disagreeing.

    ``time_lower_bound``'s meaning is emitter-path-dependent, pre-existing and
    not addressed here: v2ecoli's ``global_time`` is absolute across
    generations on the parquet emitter but resets per generation on the
    xarray path (see :func:`cumulative_time_history`). Callers that first
    normalize onto an absolute axis (e.g. ``_MultigenMixin``, via
    :func:`cumulative_time_history`) get "after absolute time T"; callers that
    filter the raw column (single-scale and multiseed ``ptools_*``, and every
    ``cd1_*`` port) get "after time T of whichever axis the emitter produced"
    — "drop the first T of each cycle" on the xarray path, but the former
    absolute reading on the already-absolute parquet path. Bound-setters
    should know which emitter produced their data before relying on
    ``time_lower_bound`` to mean one or the other.

    Distinct from :func:`skip_n_gens` (vEcoli-parity ``generation > n``, used
    by ``doubling_time_hist``/``subgenerational_expression_table``): that is a
    strict "drop the first n generations" cutoff, while this clause's
    ``generation_lower_bound`` is an inclusive "keep generation >= bound"
    threshold. The two read similarly but differ by one generation at the
    boundary (``skip_n_gens(sql, 2)`` keeps generation 3+; this clause with
    ``generation_lower_bound=2`` keeps generation 2+) because they serve
    different call sites' own intent, not because either is wrong.

    The analysis runner passes the per-analysis config dict through as
    ``variant_metadata`` (analysis_runner.py ~line 281).  For the
    variant-comparison analyses the caller is expected to supply the runner's
    ``variant_metadata`` int->name mapping (e.g.
    ``{0: "baseline", 1: "ppgpp-off", ...}``); the keys may arrive as ints or
    as JSON-stringified ints.  Any non-int-like keys (ordinary config options
    such as ``skip_n_gens``) are ignored.

    Returns ``{}`` when no variant entries are present — callers should then
    fall back to labelling variants by their integer id.

            central-carbon reactions carry O(10) flux while hundreds carry
