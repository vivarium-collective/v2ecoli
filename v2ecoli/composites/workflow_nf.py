"""``workflow_nf`` — the campaign shape, as a DAG a task scheduler can render.

The general campaign is a two-level scatter with a gather:

    ParCa(variant v)  ──►  cache_v
                             └─► for each seed m:  LineageStep(v, m)  ──┐
    ... for each variant ...                                            ├─►  analysis
                                                                        ┘

**This document is rendered, never ``run()`` in-process.** Its ParCa and analysis
nodes carry no simulation logic at all — only ports and a ``nextflow_script()``.

Two deliberate choices, both recorded because the obvious alternative is wrong:

* **ParCa uses the CLI, not ``--build``.** v2ecoli's registered ``parca`` generator
  is structural: it carries ``raw_data=None`` and does not set ``run_steps_on_init``,
  so ``Composite(doc).run(n)`` would advance ``global_time`` and **run nothing,
  exiting 0**. Emitting ``v2ecoli-parca`` as a script keeps the failure honest.

* **Analysis is not wrapped.** ``v2ecoli-analyze`` is already atomic and
  ``s3://``-capable; wrapping it would duplicate ``run_analyses``' own fan-out.

**Why each variant's lineages are NESTED rather than flat siblings.** A port maps to ONE
store path, so the obvious spelling of an N×M→1 fan-in — one ``sweep_dirs`` port wired to a
*list* of stores — cannot be constructed at all: it raises ``TypeError: unhashable type:
'list'`` inside ``Composite.__init__`` → ``core.realize`` → ``resolve``, **before the
renderer runs**. Same error process-bigraph#201 recorded for ``Mix``, same cause.

Nesting is what expresses it. Each variant's M lineages live in a sub-Composite, which #201
renders as a DSL2 sub-workflow::

    workflow runs_v0 {
        take: cache
        main:
        ch_sweep_v0_s0 = lineage_v0_s0(cache, ...)
        ch_sweep_v0_s1 = lineage_v0_s1(cache, ...)
        _merged = ch_sweep_s0
        _merged = _merged.mix(ch_sweep_s1)
        emit: _merged.collect()
    }

so M channels arrive at the parent as ONE. The analysis then takes one named port per
variant. Measured at Run 4 scale — 84 variants × 4 seeds = **336 lineages**: 421 process
blocks, 84 sub-workflows, rendered in 2.5 s, with the parent call at 84 arguments (under
Java's 255-parameter limit) and every mix binary.

The per-variant ParCa node is what makes a *strain* sweep real rather than nominal:
``new_genes`` / ``bundle_overrides`` reach **ParCa**, so each variant gets its own
cache. Threading them to the lineage instead — which is what today's
``lineage_ray_batch`` façade does by collapsing ``variants`` into
``config_overrides`` — gives one shared cache for the whole sweep, i.e. N runs of
the same genotype wearing different labels.
