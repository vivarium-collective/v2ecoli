"""Run mbp-* simulation variants past first division, tracked in the
workspace-shared sqlite registry.

This is the v2 runner. v1 used ``sqlite_emitter()`` as a context manager
which injects a SQLiteEmitter Step into the composite — that path hits
``UNIQUE constraint failed: history.simulation_id, history.step`` at the
first division (both daughters try to emit at the same step). v2 uses
:func:`v2ecoli.library.sqlite_run.run_multigen_sqlite` with external
emitter management + lineage-following (``single_daughters=True``) so
runs continue past division.

Each run is also tagged with ``study_slug`` + ``investigation_slug`` so
the dashboard's Simulations DB tab groups them under the
``multiscale-bioprocess`` investigation.

Currently runnable variants. (This list once excluded anything needing
the upstream ``pbg-bioreactor-transport-fork`` PR for mbp-03's
BiRDTransportProcess; that merged 2026-07-27, so the coupled composite is
runnable here now.)

  mbp-01-time-varying-environment:
    static-env-baseline   — baseline_time_varying_env (env_driver_mode=static)
                            single-cell + division, regression-guard

  mbp-02-population-aggregation:
    aggregator-cpa1       — baseline_population at cells_per_agent=1.0
    aggregator-cpa1e6     — at 1e6 (scaling-factor sweep)
    aggregator-cpa1e9     — at 1e9 (high-density representative sampling)

  mbp-04-multigeneration-runs:
    reactor-bird-coupled-batch-multigen
                          — v2ecoli cells <-> BiRD 0D reactor, batch.
                            Carries the import-gate booleans (v2ecoli#572).

  Cross-investigation reference:
    baseline-reference    — unmodified v2ecoli.composites.ecoli_baseline

Default duration is 120 sim-min (~2 doublings). A variant may override that
via VARIANT_DEFAULTS when its window is a study-enforced param rather than a
runner preference (mbp-04: 240 sim-min); an explicit --duration-sec /
--max-generations always wins.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_mbp_tracked.py [--variant <name>] [--duration-sec N]
