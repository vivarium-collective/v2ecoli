"""Run identity + code provenance, importable from library code.

These two helpers used to live in ``scripts/`` (``_run_provenance.py``,
``_provenance.py``), which made them unavailable to anything under
``v2ecoli/`` — ``scripts/`` is not a package. The cache in
``sim_vector_cache`` needs both to stamp what it writes, so they live here
now and the script modules re-export them for their existing callers.

Run identity follows ``docs/conventions/run-provenance.md``:
``experiment_id == run_id == the top parquet partition key``.

``build_run_identity`` / ``write_run_identity`` (v2ecoli#472/#473) are the
one-record-per-run combiner: code identity + cache content fingerprint +
design/grid metadata, written to a canonical ``run_identity.json`` sidecar
that every runner writes and ``sim_vector_cache._run_commit`` reads. See
``RUN_IDENTITY_FILENAME``'s docstring for why this is a dedicated file
rather than a new key stuffed into each runner's own summary shape.
