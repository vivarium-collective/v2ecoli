# --- cross-path dose-onset equivalence (#769/#771/#773) ----------------------
#
# The per-PR unit tests above pin each fix in isolation (a single generation's
# _run_until_division / _elapsed_after_run). The bug they kept missing was a
# CROSS-PATH one: the chain-dispatch path (tick-driven, the runner stepped one
# second at a time, interval=1) and the single-window LineageStep / Nextflow
# path (one big update() per generation, division found by polling every
# division_poll_interval seconds) implemented DIFFERENT lineage/generation time
# semantics. A field-timeline dose scheduled at an ABSOLUTE cumulative lineage
# time (Run 3's onset at 10,000 s) fired on the chain path but never on the
# single-window path, because the two paths booked different per-generation
# durations into lineage_time_offset. These tests drive a whole multi-generation
# lineage through update() under BOTH drive modes against the same scripted
# division times and assert the cumulative booked time (hence the generation a
# cumulative-time dose lands in) is identical.
