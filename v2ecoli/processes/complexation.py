Complexation
============

This process encodes molecular simulation of macromolecular complexation,
in which monomers are assembled into complexes. Macromolecular complexation
is done by identifying complexation reactions that are possible (which are
reactions that have sufficient counts of all sub-components), performing one
randomly chosen possible reaction, and re-identifying all possible complexation
reactions. This process assumes that macromolecular complexes form spontaneously,
and that complexation reactions are fast and complete within the time step of the
simulation.

Mathematical Model
------------------
Complexation is simulated as a continuous-time Markov chain (Gillespie
algorithm) via the ``StochasticSystem`` class from ``stochastic_arrow``.

Given a stoichiometry matrix S (molecules x reactions) and a rate vector k,
the system evolves molecule counts x(t) over the timestep dt:

    x(t + dt) = StochasticSystem.evolve(dt, x(t), k)

Each reaction j fires stochastically with propensity:

    a_j = k_j * product_i(x_i choose |S_ij|)   for all reactant species i

The net molecule count change is:

    delta_x = x(t + dt) - x(t) = S @ occurrences

Each complex's reactants are complex-specific (no shared resource
competition), so this runs as a plain Step with a single Gillespie call.
